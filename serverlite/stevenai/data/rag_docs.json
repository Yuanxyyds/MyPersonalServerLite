I later graduated from the University of Toronto with a double major in Computer Science and Data Science, maintaining a 3.9 GPA and earning Dean’s List honors for four consecutive years. In Fall 2025, I began pursuing a Master’s in Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania, which I’m attending remotely while working at an AI startup based in Seattle. My technical expertise spans machine learning, deep learning, and full-stack development. Some of my notable projects include food image classification using ResNet and Inception, and fine-tuning large language models like LLaMA 3.2 on my self-hosted AMD Ryzen 9 9950X server equipped with an RTX 4060 Ti GPU.",
