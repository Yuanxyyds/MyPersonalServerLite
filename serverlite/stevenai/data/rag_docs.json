I later graduated from the University of Toronto with a double major in Computer Science and Data Science, maintaining a 3.9 GPA and earning Dean’s List honors for four consecutive years. In Fall 2025, I began pursuing a Master’s in Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania, which I’m attending remotely while working at an AI startup based in Seattle. My technical expertise spans machine learning, deep learning, and full-stack development. Some of my notable projects include food image classification using ResNet and Inception, and fine-tuning large language models like LLaMA 3.2 on my self-hosted AMD Ryzen 9 9950X server equipped with an RTX 4060 Ti GPU.",

Three neighborhoods in Beijing hold deep emotional significance: Donghuwan, the park-like community where I grew up and formed lasting friendships—later becoming one of my family’s best financial decisions after selling the property; the National Defense University of PLA China, where my paternal grandparents lived and I spent vibrant summers; and China Agricultural University, home to my maternal grandparents and the setting of family traditions like handmade dumplings during Spring Festival. In Beijing, I developed many of my lifelong interests: I played piano for over a decade, joined school basketball and soccer leagues, captained an ice hockey team, and became an early player of Honor of Kings before its international launch. I also fondly remember local street foods like grilled cold noodles (Kaolengmian) and stuffed flatbreads (Shouzhuabing), which were staples of everyday life.

He consistently observed how students were feeling—if they seemed tired or stressed, he would take us outside to play and recharge. His thoughtful and compassionate approach made learning both engaging and meaningful, and it taught me that education is as much about nurturing students as it is about delivering content. Mr. Zhang’s creativity and care left a lasting impression on me and played a significant role in shaping my values. He is one of the key reasons I have seriously considered becoming a teacher myself.

Second, with growing emphasis on diversity and fairness, we aimed to onboard a wider range of restaurants, but couldn’t ensure enough demand to justify discounted pricing for all partners. Third, health-related regulations from the university limited the sale of food from external vendors on campus. Looking ahead, we plan to pivot toward a flexible coupon-based model that supports not only restaurants but also other vendors seeking to reach the student market through tiered discounts. Campus Ease will manage student verification and offer subscription-based premium tiers for partners. While we will preserve the original dining functionalities of Campus Eats, this expanded vision reflects our goal to make Campus Ease a broader platform for student-focused savings and campus engagement.",

It is hosted on my own home server, giving me full control over my cloud infrastructure and data privacy. The system is backed by a 4TB Seagate IronWolf Pro HDD, providing ample and reliable storage capacity for my photos, learning materials, important documents, and media files. Accessible at https://cloud.liustev6.ca, StevCloud allows me to seamlessly access and manage my data from anywhere while also enabling secure file sharing. Because it’s fully self-hosted, I avoid reliance on third-party cloud providers and retain full autonomy over system configuration, security, and performance.",

        "content": "AISIM (AI Simulation Game) is an 7-player AI-powered social deduction game designed for research on large language model (LLM) behavior. The game simulates complex multi-agent interactions where each AI character engages in dialogue, tracks memory, and reasons toward hidden goals. AISIM connects to a 2D pixel-style Godot frontend, which renders real-time character portraits, dynamic conversations, and group chat scenes, creating an immersive and visually engaging environment. The backend is built using FastAPI and SQLite, enabling modular simulation of game rounds, conversation flows, and persistent player state management. AISIM integrates multiple LLMs—using LLaMA for real-time character dialogues and Deepseek for memory updates and strategic reasoning. Role-specific system prompts and contextual memory logs are employed to generate unique, goal-oriented behavior for each AI player. This setup allows researchers to explore how different LLMs interact, adapt strategies, and simulate social behavior in a controlled, game-like setting.",

It serves as both a smart home control hub and an LLM-powered conversational assistant that I can talk to naturally. I use it to control lights, open doors with sensor triggers, and interact with my smart environment simply by speaking—like saying “turn on the light” or “open the door.” The assistant features a custom text-to-speech engine for natural voice responses and connects to all my smart devices via the Home Assistant API. I also built a real-time GUI using Kivy, which provides live voice feedback, touch control, and a smooth interface for managing devices. Beyond automation, it’s my playground for hardware exploration and AI experimentation, offering me a compact, open-source alternative to commercial systems—fully tailored to my needs, fully under my control.",
