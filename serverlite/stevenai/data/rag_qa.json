In recent years, I’ve enjoyed memorable trips, including a relaxing getaway to Cuba with my girlfriend and two extensive journeys through China in 2021 and 2025. These trips took me to nearly every region, with stops in Beijing, Nanjing, Yangzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai. Each city offered unique cultural experiences that deepened my appreciation for China’s regional diversity, rich cuisine, and rapid modern development.",

These early experiences instilled a sense of discipline and time management that continues to shape how I approach challenges today.",

      "answer": "We paused our projects in 2025 due to several key challenges. First, our Grab-and-Go business model relied on a large initial user base—essential for restaurants to remain profitable after offering discounts and for us to cover delivery, platform, and staffing costs. Second, with growing emphasis on diversity and fairness, we aimed to onboard a wider range of restaurants, but couldn’t ensure enough demand to justify discounted pricing for all partners. Third, health-related regulations from the university limited the sale of food from external vendors on campus. Looking ahead, we plan to pivot toward a flexible coupon-based model that supports not only restaurants but also other vendors seeking to reach the student market through tiered discounts. Campus Ease will manage student verification and offer subscription-based premium tiers for partners. While we will preserve the original dining functionalities of Campus Eats, this expanded vision reflects our goal to make Campus Ease a broader platform for student-focused savings and campus engagement.",

For convenience and self-development, I shifted the project to React.js with Bootstrap in 2023, introducing a major UI update with cyber-casual styles. In 2025, I redesigned it again with cyber neon colors, giving it a slightly more professional look and adding more animations and sections. New features include the built-in 3D server room with Three.js, a two-column gallery with varying scroll speeds, and other interactive elements.",

      "answer": "The app features a reward system powered by the integration of iOS Screen Time APIs, allowing for accurate tracking of phone usage. It maintains a local-vendor reward database so students can exchange their earned time for discounts, contributing to a 30% average reduction in screen time among active users. LockIn is available as both a mobile app and a web platform. The mobile version was developed using Swift for iOS and Flutter for UI refinement, while the web version was built using Next.js. Firebase was integrated to enable real-time updates and seamless user experience across platforms.",

      "answer": "To address these challenges, I added a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer. This upgrade uses bge-large-en-v1.5 to embed content and stores it in a FAISS index. The knowledge base was completely restructured: instead of using duplicated Q&A pairs, I rewrote the data into concise fact chunks, each appearing only once. When a user sends a question, the system performs two types of retrieval: (1) a top-3 direct fact match, and (2) a top-3 question match, based on five auto-generated sample questions per fact chunk. Only question embeddings are stored in the RAG index, with the corresponding answers saved in the metadata. The final prompt includes these six retrieved contexts before being passed to the chatbot.",

He attended St. John’s Academy, where our parents worked. William is exceptionally outgoing, energetic, and athletic. He excels in sports like soccer, basketball, softball, and hockey, often holding his own against older kids. He’s also a skilled gamer with a sharp mind, though he sometimes gets a bit too absorbed in video games and can be impulsive. Playful and mischievous, William has a habit of sneaking his iPad to play when no one’s watching and is known in the family for his humorous bragging. Despite his playful side, he’s also remarkably responsible for his age—especially in how he looks after Charles—and he shows clear musical talent as a piano player, even if his focus wavers during practice. His ability to balance fun, responsibility, and talent makes him a truly special and memorable younger brother.",

His technical fluency and adaptability are truly impressive. Our most meaningful collaboration was on the Campus Eats project. Tom was instrumental in business strategy and UI/UX design. He applied the double diamond design process in Figma, conducted extensive market research, and led partnership-building efforts with student unions and local businesses. On the technical side, he evaluated features like Stripe integration, recommendation algorithms, and in-app advertisements. Outside of work, we often hang out—playing games, brainstorming side projects, and coding for fun. Tom is incredibly clever, curious, and has a strong sense of initiative.

From the beginning, Kevin distinguished himself with his intelligence and drive, excelling in the IB program with near-perfect scores. We later both attended the University of Toronto—Kevin in Computer Engineering and myself in Data Science—and although our programs differed, our bond remained strong. Kevin played a key leadership role in our Campus Eats project as the technical lead, overseeing the design and implementation of the platform’s core infrastructure. His deep understanding of engineering principles, strong communication skills, and reliability made him an invaluable asset. Kevin is also incredibly talented musically—his singing voice often stuns people during karaoke nights, and he’s always the life of the party at KTV. He balances technical excellence with creativity, humor, and emotional intelligence. Whether we’re reminiscing about high school, building projects, or just enjoying downtime together, Kevin’s presence has always been steady, uplifting, and irreplaceable. He’s one of my most trusted friends and collaborators.",

      "answer": "Eric Wu became one of my closest friends during our time living at New College at the University of Toronto. Our bond grew especially strong during one quiet summer when we were the only two students remaining in residence. We developed a daily rhythm of cooking together—his fried pork with onion became my all-time favorite—and shared meals turned into some of our most meaningful moments. We spent countless hours playing games, reflecting on life, and discussing our dreams of one day becoming professors. Eric’s intellectual curiosity is matched by a calm maturity and a global outlook—he’s traveled widely, conducted international research in Singapore, and always brings a thoughtful perspective to our conversations. Beyond academics, he’s one of the most consistent and emotionally grounded people I know. Even now, while pursuing his Master’s at McGill, we remain in close contact through game nights, calls, and planned visits. Eric is someone who brings warmth, insight, and stability to any friendship. Our connection is built on trust, shared aspirations, and deep mutual respect, and I know we’ll continue supporting each other for many years to come.",

      "answer": "Praharsh Bhatt was my supervisor and mentor during my internship at Johnson Controls, and he had a profound impact on my technical and professional growth. Originally from India, Praharsh is a passionate coder and entrepreneur who began programming at a young age. By the age of 19, he had already co-founded a startup and launched his own company—an impressive feat that speaks to his ambition and talent. During my internship, his hands-on mentorship guided me not only through server setup and software architecture but also inspired me to build my own startup, Campus Eats. His experience spans full-stack mobile development, scalable infrastructure, and effective problem-solving across industries. Even after the internship ended, we’ve remained in close contact. I frequently meet with Praharsh to exchange ideas about new technologies and to discuss personal projects. His continued support and feedback have been invaluable as I explore new ventures and refine my technical direction. Having him as a supervisor early in my career has been incredibly fortunate—his guidance shaped my confidence, broadened my skills, and continues to influence the way I approach software development and entrepreneurship.",
