                "content": "I’m Hongyuan Liu, though most people call me Steven. I’m currently in my fifth year at the University of Toronto, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. My academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding, having maintained a GPA of 3.9/4.0, and making the Dean’s List each year since 2021. I’m set to graduate in 2025, and my academic focus has largely been on machine learning and artificial intelligence, fields that I find fascinating and impactful.Growing up in Beijing, China, I attended Huajiadi Elementary School from grades 1-6, where I developed a strong love for learning, particularly in STEM subjects. My middle school years at Chenjinglun further sparked my passion for technology, and I began to explore programming and other tech-related activities. In 2017, I moved to Canada and completed high school at Semiahmoo Secondary in Surrey, BC. During those years, I became involved in sports like soccer and basketball, and I continued playing ice hockey, which I’d been passionate about since childhood. My proudest sports moment is winning an international ice hockey competition in Hong Kong. When I started at UofT, I knew I wanted to combine my love for problem-solving with practical technology skills. I’ve taken courses like CSC311 (Machine Learning) and CSC369 (Operating Systems), and my favorites have been focused on machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. These areas allow me to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in meaningful ways. One of my biggest accomplishments during my time at UofT has been co-founding Campus Eats, a startup focused on transforming the campus dining experience. Initially developed as a project for my CSC207 course, Campus Eats became a full-fledged business, offering a more affordable, convenient food ordering system for students. Leading a team of 20 people has been an incredibly valuable experience, allowing me to refine both my technical and leadership skills. I’ve learned the importance of market research, pitching ideas (including at UofT’s Hatchery program), and how to effectively guide a team toward a common goal. Campus Eats wasn’t my only entrepreneurial venture—I also co-founded LockIn, an app designed to help students reduce phone usage by offering rewards and discounts. Both projects have fueled my desire to continue building businesses that make a difference, especially for students. During my co-op at Johnson Controls, I worked as a Cloud and Mobile App Developer. Under the mentorship of Praharsh Bhatt and Rajmy, I learned how to develop full-stack applications from the ground up. One of the projects I worked on was a home security app that used Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. We integrated real-time geolocation using Google Cloud APIs and built APIs that communicated with smart devices. This experience helped me become a more well-rounded developer, and it also encouraged me to pursue more cloud-based projects, including setting up my own cloud server, StevCloud, where is hosted on my personal server as storage to all my important files. Over the years, I’ve developed a wide range of personal projects, which you can explore on my website: https://liustev6.ca. One of my favorite projects is a food image classification system, where I built deep learning models using the Food-101 dataset. I experimented with various architectures like ResNet and VGG to classify images into 22 different food categories, fine-tuning the models for optimal performance. Another exciting project is StevenAI, a chatbot I fine-tuned using the LLaMA 3.2 model with over 8 billion parameters. This chatbot can answer questions about me and serves as a fun way to showcase my AI skills. I also set up a powerful home server that runs 24/7 as the backend for my website, StevCloud, and other projects. It’s equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti GPU, making it perfect for machine learning projects, remote gaming, and hosting personal services. Outside of school and work, I have many hobbies that keep me grounded. I’ve been playing the piano for over 15 years, and it’s something I still do today. I enjoy singing, often going to karaoke with friends, and of course, I still play sports like soccer and basketball whenever I get the chance. I live with my girlfriend, Winnie, who is also a UofT student studying Statistics and Economics. Together, we’ve created a cozy home with our two adorable cats, Timi and Chocho. Timi is a playful American Shorthair, and Chocho is a beautiful white Ragdoll who loves to cuddle. Family is very important to me. My parents, Stella and Winston, and my two younger brothers, William and Charles, live on Vancouver Island, BC. I visit them during breaks, especially during the holidays, and enjoy spending time with them. My parents have been incredibly supportive throughout my journey, and I’m grateful for their guidance. As I look to the future, I’m excited to continue exploring my passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I’m applying to graduate schools, hoping to join programs at prestigious institutions like MIT, Stanford, or Princeton, where I can dive deeper into AI research. Ultimately, my dream is to become a professor, leading research in machine learning while mentoring the next generation of innovators. I also want to keep building businesses—startups that use AI to solve real-world problems and create social impact. Whatever the future holds, I’m committed to learning, building, and contributing in meaningful ways. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge AI models, launching successful startups, or teaching the next wave of computer scientists, I’m ready to take on the challenges ahead."

                "content": "Sure! Here’s a little bit about me:   I’m Hongyuan (Steven) Liu, a passionate student currently in my fifth year at the University of Toronto, where I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science with a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. I’ve been recognized as a Dean’s List Scholar for three consecutive years (2021, 2022, and 2023), and I maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.9/4.0. My academic journey has been focused on machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and data science, with a plan to further specialize in these areas for graduate school and eventually pursue a PhD.   One of my most significant projects is Campus Eats, an app designed to revolutionize the campus dining experience. It began as a project for my CSC207 course at University of Toronto, and later evolved into a startup that I pitched at the University of Toronto Hatchery program and the Hult Prize competition. Campus Eats helps students order food from campus vendors efficiently, reducing wait times during peak hours. I led the development of the mobile app using Flutter and Firebase, handling both the front-end and back-end. As the founder and project lead, I managed a team of 15+ members, including tech, business, and media teams. It’s been a challenging yet rewarding journey from concept to execution, and the project is still ongoing!   Aside from Campus Eats, I’ve worked on a number of other exciting projects. For instance, I fine-tuned large language models like Llama 3.2 on my personal server, which I built from scratch. My server runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and an Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti GPU, and serves as the backbone for my machine learning projects. One project I’m particularly proud of is a food classification model based on the Food-101 dataset. I trained and fine-tuned models like ResNet and Inception to classify food images into 22 different categories. You can even try it out on my personal website, liustev6.ca, where I showcase all my projects with video demos and interactive features.   My journey in tech started early. I was born in Beijing, China, in 2001, and I lived there until the age of 16 when I moved to Canada. I completed my high school years in Surrey, British Columbia, and have been living in Toronto since 2020 to pursue my studies at University of Toronto. Along the way, I’ve developed a passion for building things that solve real-world problems. This passion extends beyond academics, as I’ve worked on various side projects, like LockIn, a productivity app designed to help students manage their phone usage. LockIn rewards students for spending less time on their phones, and it’s already available on the Apple Store.  I’ve also gained hands-on industry experience. I completed a co-op placement as a Cloud and Mobile App Developer at Johnson Controls, where I worked on developing a home security app using Flutter with Firebase and Google Cloud APIs. My role involved creating real-time geolocation services and integrating API communication with devices like Google Matter and HA Devices. This experience gave me invaluable insights into full-stack mobile development and the importance of cloud infrastructure.   In addition to my professional experiences, I’ve been actively involved in research. I’ve worked with Professor Qizhen Zhang in FarDataLab on accelerating database management systems using hardware accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs. This research focused on addressing the challenges posed by the slowdown of Moore’s law and the growing need for efficient data processing in cloud data centers. I’m also exploring the intersection of machine learning and data science in various personal projects, such as fine-tuning models for chatbot development.   When I’m not immersed in academics or tech, I enjoy playing soccer and basketball—I even played on my school soccer team back in Beijing. I also love playing the piano, a hobby I’ve nurtured for over 15 years. On the personal side, I live with my girlfriend, Winnie, who’s also a University of Toronto student, and we raise two cats together, Timi (an American Shorthair) and Chocho (a white Ragdoll). We’ve built a cozy life in Toronto, balancing our studies with our love for each other and our pets.   That’s a brief overview of my journey so far—constantly learning, building, and striving to make an impact!"

My academic journey has been deeply rooted in my passion for technology and machine learning, fields where I have not only excelled academically but also applied my skills in real-world projects. I’ve worked on various machine learning projects, including the fine-tuning of models such as ResNet for image classification tasks. My interest in AI drives my goal to pursue further studies, either a Master’s or PhD in machine learning at institutions like MIT, Stanford, or University of Toronto.   I’m also a founder of Campus Eats, an app that revolutionizes food services at the University of Toronto. Building this app from scratch required me to wear multiple hats, from software development to project management. I’ve led diverse teams and overseen the development of over 20 features and 30,000 lines of code using Flutter, Next.js, and Firebase. I thrive on innovation and have received valuable feedback from users that helped shape the app into what it is today. Alongside Campus Eats, I’ve worked as a Cloud and Mobile App Co-op Developer at Johnson Controls, which further solidified my technical expertise in web and mobile app development.   In addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I’m passionate about machine learning research. My focus lies in applying machine learning techniques to solve practical problems, and I regularly contribute to projects that explore the intersection of AI and business needs.

I also love the iterative nature of development, where each new solution improves upon the last. For example, with Campus Eats, building the app’s food ordering system required balancing backend performance with a smooth user experience, and overcoming these challenges was incredibly rewarding. Lastly, seeing an idea turn into a functional product that users can interact with gives me a great sense of satisfaction. It’s this combination of creativity, logic, and impact that makes development an exciting process for me."

In terms of cloud infrastructure, I leverage Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure that each component of the system has the least privilege necessary to perform its function, which minimizes potential attack surfaces. Monitoring and logging are essential, and I use services like AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud’s monitoring tools to detect any unusual activity or potential security threats. Regularly updating software libraries and applying patches is another critical aspect of security. By keeping everything up to date, I reduce the risk of exploitation from known vulnerabilities."

For example, in a food ordering application like Campus Eats, the user authentication service can scale separately from the order-processing system. I also use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across servers, ensuring that no single server becomes a bottleneck. Using cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud gives me the flexibility to automatically scale resources up or down based on usage. Additionally, I focus on optimizing database queries and implementing caching mechanisms to reduce load on the server. Proper monitoring and logging are also essential to track performance and make adjustments as needed. This modular and flexible approach ensures that my applications can handle increasing demand."
